Version 3.0:

•	The entire game is now “apple catcher” themed.

•	Start menu includes options menu which allows the player to turn sound effects and music on/off, as well as choosing between
  two different songs.
  
•	While playing, the sound effect that occurred after a user typed a correct letter was seriously delayed. This is fixed in
  later versions.
