Version 1.0: 
•	Version 1.0 is the original concept. At the time, I didn’t have a background story as to why the player would want to type the
letters before they hit the bottom. 

Version 1.0 is just the letters falling down the screen, and the player being able to type them. 

There is no sound, and for some odd reason the ground is misplaced.
